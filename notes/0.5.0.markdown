_scala-ssh_ is a Scala library providing remote shell access via SSH.
It builds on [sshj][] to provide the following features:

* Remote execution of one or more shell commands
* Access to `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr` and exitcode of remote shell commands
* Authentication via password or public key
* Host key verification via `known_hosts` file or explicit fingerprint
* Convenient configuration of remote host properties via config file, resource or directly in code
* Scala-idiomatic API
